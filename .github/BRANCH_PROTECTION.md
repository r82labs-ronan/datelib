# Branch Protection Policy

This repository enforces branch protection on the `main` branch to ensure code quality and security.

## Protection Rules

The following rules are enforced for the `main` branch:

1. **Required Pull Request Reviews**: At least **1 approving review** is required before merging
2. **Code Owners Review**: Reviews from code owners (defined in `.github/CODEOWNERS`) are required
3. **No Direct Pushes**: Changes must be made through pull requests

## How This Works

### CODEOWNERS File
The `.github/CODEOWNERS` file defines who is responsible for code in this repository. When branch protection is enabled with "Require review from Code Owners", these individuals or teams are automatically requested for review on pull requests.

### Branch Protection Workflow
The `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml` GitHub Actions workflow helps validate that pull requests meet the review requirements before they can be merged to `main`.

## Setting Up Branch Protection (Repository Administrator)

To fully enable these protections, a repository administrator needs to configure branch protection rules via GitHub:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Branch protection rules**
2. Add a rule for the `main` branch
3. Enable the following settings:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
     - ✅ **Require approvals**: Set to at least **1**
     - ✅ **Require review from Code Owners**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging** (optional but recommended)
   - ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (recommended)

## Developer Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push your branch and create a pull request to `main`
4. Wait for at least 1 approval from a code owner
5. Once approved and all checks pass, merge the pull request

If you have questions about the branch protection policy, please contact the repository administrators.
